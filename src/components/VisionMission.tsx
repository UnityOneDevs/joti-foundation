              We, at Joti Foundation are driven by empathy and a strong sense of
              justice to fight for the abolition of poverty, gender inequality
              and a more sustainable future.

            <p className='text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              We strive to build a future in which children do not go hungry but
              thrive, women do not hide but shine, villages do not struggle but
              grow and people with disabilities do not give up on the idea of a
              secure, healthy and nourished future where there is no
              discrimination.

              Team Joti Foundation vows to work at grassroot level and connect
              with the people in a better way. This would further our
              understanding of their needs- emotionally, mentally, physically
              and psychologically. We are here to reform the system, spark our
              country&apos;s future and make a difference in the lives of
              others!
            </p>
