                      We, at Joti Foundation are driven by empathy and a strong
                      sense of justice to fight for the abolition of poverty,
                      gender inequality and a more sustainable future. We strive
                      to build a future in which children do not go hungry but
                      thrive, women do not hide but shine, villages do not
                      struggle but grow and people with disabilities do not give
                      up on the idea of a secure, healthy and nourished future
                      where there is no discrimination. Team Joti Foundation
                      vows to work at grassroot level and connect with the
                      people in a better way. This would further our
                      understanding of their needs- emotionally, mentally,
                      physically and psychologically. We are here to reform the
                      system, spark our country's future and make a difference
                      in the lives of others!

                    <p>
                      Late Prabjot Singh, loving father, husband and
                      philanthropist is the true inspiration behind the founding
                      of Joti Foundation. Mr. Prabjot Singh was the most-trusted
                      and humble personality in his hometown, Sri Muktsar Sahib,
                      Punjab. With his great heartedness and magnanimous spirit,
                      he led the expansion and development of the entire town
                      without singing any of his efforts. Every soul that
                      crossed his path, was openly welcomed for any help that
                      they ever required. His charitable tales have no end even
                      today, as people visit Sherewala, they are told of a
                      leader who took care of several families in need, took it
                      upon himself to fund the education of children and help
                      young women to stand on their own feet, help officials
                      looking for guidance and any support; and many such good
                      deeds that have become an inspiration for many.

                      majoring in Literature. Without her supporting me and my
                      family, we would not have been able to turn our lives

                      During her school days at Convent Of Jesus And Mary
                      Waverley, Mussoorie, Mrs Prabkiran discovered her natural
                      talent of being a teacher and was drawn to it even more
                      during her college time. She noticed many disadvantaged
                      children in her locality and took it upon herself to start
                      teaching them with great passion and sincerity. Many
                      children who were lucky enough to attend school started
                      doing exceptionally well in their studies and behaviorally
                      at home, many could start conversing in English fluently
                      which solidified her aim to ensure inclusive and equitable
                      quality education for all. Since the past decade, Mrs
                      Prabkiran has been actively funding education and teaching
                      poor children in Sherewala, her father's hometown. Mrs
                      Prabkiran is the founding Chairperson of Joti Foundation
                      that is dedicated to Promote Lifelong Learning
                      Opportunities for underprivileged children across India.
